# Spokesperson
## Overview

This project introduces a groundbreaking approach to online dating by utilizing GPT-based AI to create personalized "Spokespersons" for users. These AI representations simulate dating experiences on behalf of users, engaging with other Spokespersons in a variety of imaginative scenarios. The outcomes provide users with insightful summaries, conversation highlights, and interpretive images, offering a novel and entertaining way to assess compatibility while reducing the anxieties associated with traditional online dating.

## Key Features

- AI-Facilitated Personalization

  - An interactive AI Facilitator guides users through a conversational process to create their Spokesperson, capturing individual personality traits, preferences, communication styles, and values for authentic representation.

- Simulated Dating Scenarios

  - Spokespersons embark on simulated dates in diverse settings—ranging from cozy coffee shops to adventurous spaceship journeys—allowing for endless possibilities and engaging narratives that reflect real human interactions.

- Insightful Summaries and Visuals

  - Users receive detailed summaries of the simulated dates, including conversation highlights and AI-generated images that bring the experience to life, enabling them to gauge potential compatibility without direct communication pressure.

- Enhanced Compatibility Insights

  - By observing their Spokesperson's interactions, users gain deeper understanding of potential matches, fostering connections based on meaningful conversations and shared experiences.
